                <h3>Become World's NO.1 Developer</h3>
                <p>One of the best things you can do to become a great developer is to find an excellent mentor. A good mentor will provide sound advice on everything from architecture to design, and even how to improve your career path.

                    A person who is not in the same company or location may be the best mentor for you. You can talk to them and get their advice on the phone, via email, or online. A mentor doesn't have to work at your company nor be an expert developer.
                    
                    Find someone who understands software development and has had success in their career that you respect.</p>
